- 👋 Hi, I’m @hankli0924, you can call me Hank
- 👀 I’m interested in programming, 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to create LLM application

- ⚡ Fun fact: 🎮 When I'm not crafting code, you'll find me strategizing on the Chinese chessboard. 🌏 My moves are as calculated and elegant as my brush strokes in practicing calligraphy—a timeless art form that teaches patience and precision. And to keep my mind-body balance, I unwind with Health Qigong Ba Duan Jin, a flowing practice that's centuries-old but keeps me evergreen for modern-day coding challenges!
